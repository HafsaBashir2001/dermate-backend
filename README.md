# Dermate Backend - Skincare Products Recommendation System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dermate Backend for the Skincare Products Recommendation System. This backend is responsible for serving predictions for skin type and acne severity, recommending skincare products, and managing product data.

## Models

### Skin Type Model

The skin type prediction model uses deep learning to classify user-uploaded skin images into one of the following categories: "dry," "oily," or "combination." The model should be trained and saved as a checkpoint or model file.

### Acne Severity Model

The acne severity prediction model employs machine learning to assess acne levels based on images. It categorizes acne as "normal," "moderate," or "severe." This model should also be trained and saved.

## Data

### Product Data

The skincare product data is typically stored in a CSV file. It contains information such as product name, ingredients, and suitable skin types. This data is used to recommend products to users based on their skin type and concerns.
